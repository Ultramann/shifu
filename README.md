# shifu

SHell Interface Function Utiltities, or shifu, is the set of utility functions to make creating a cli from a shell script easy. Shells make flag parsing quite easy but standard cli features are much harder to accomplish, e.g.:
* subcommands
* generating scoped help output
* tab completion, for interactive shells
